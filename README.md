#### Computer Networks(International): NJU CS 2023 Fall

This repository serves as a compilation of all experiments conducted throughout the semester. The labs are organized into two main sections:

* TCP Protocol Stack Implementation (lab0 to lab4): Explore the foundational aspects of networking by building a TCP protocol stack. Labs 0 through 4 focus on constructing the TCP protocol stack, providing a hands-on experience in understanding the intricacies of communication over the Internet.

* Networking and Link Layer Infrastructure Experiments (lab5 to lab6): Lab 5 and 6 delve into essential experiments concerning the networking and link layer. These experiments cover fundamental infrastructure elements, offering practical insights into the workings of these layers.

You may check the different labs simply by changing the branches.

All codes are conducted within the soft deadline (soft ddl) and passed all the tests.

Feel free to customize the content to better suit your specific repository and instructions.

This repo might lead you to a cheating trip, but I'd like to quote a note given by my friend (Shannju)[https://github.com/Shannju/njucser_helphelp]:

```text
真心希望这份答案能帮你更好的纠错，或者能让你在DDL前睡一个好觉，甚至和喜欢的人多出去玩一会儿。

但是每个选择都有其代价，多了一个可能性是用以更好的安排自己的时间，而不是一个摆的捷径。
```


Last but not the least: **Welcome to hack me.**
